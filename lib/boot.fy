# boot.fy
# This file gets loaded & run by Fancy automatically.
# It loads in Fancy's standard library & core classes.

# NOTE:
# Order DOES matter here, so watch out what you're doing.
# In general, it's best to add any autoload-files at the end of the
# current list (if adding them here is really necessary at all).

# rbx.fy loads all the files in lib/rbx/ in the correct order, which
# define all the functionality to let fancy run on rbx.
# also, they might override functionality defined in lib/ to reuse
# existing ruby methods etc.
